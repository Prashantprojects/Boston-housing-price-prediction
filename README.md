# Boston-housing-price-prediction

The project is baed on the Boston housing data set. It contains details of 506 houses in Boston city. 

The aim of this project was to try different Machine Learning models and see which model has the highest accuracy. The below Machine Learning Models have been applied:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Ada Boost
- XGBoost
- KNN
- SVM

The project consist of the following steps:

- Reading the data in python
- Defining the problem statement
- Identifying the Target variable
- Looking at the distribution of Target variable
- Basic Data exploration
- Rejecting useless columns
- Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
- Feature Selection based on data distribution
- Outlier treatment
- Missing Values treatment
- Visual correlation analysis
- Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
- Converting data to numeric for ML
- Sampling and K-fold cross validation
- Trying multiple Regression algorithms
- Selecting the best Model
- Deploying the best model in production
